# LDA Text modelling of US State of the Union Speech
This exploratory research project was part of graduate coursework (590A) in Winter 2015.  

## Description
Each year, the president of the United States gives a State of the Union Address and Message. In
these speeches, the president usually discusses different ongoing home issues as well as global issues. We
have collected the last 25 years' speeches (i.e. from Ronald Reagan (1981) to Barak H. Obama
(2015)) to train our State-of-Union-Address topic model.

In this exploratory project, we used Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [1,2] to identify addressed topics in these speeches.
