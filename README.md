# LDA Text modelling of US State of the Union Speech

## Description
This exploratory research project was part of graduate coursework (590A).  

In this report, first we briefly focus on topic modeling. Then, we discuss a special type of topic
modelling called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2] [1], which is the foundation for many other
topic models. And finally we present the results on an application of LDA on a real world data set.


In each year, the president of the United State gives a State of the Union Address and Massage. In
these speeches, they usually discuss on different ongoing home issues as well as global issues. We
have collected those speeches for 25 years, i.e. from Ronald Reagan (1981) to Barak H. Obama
(2015), to train our State-of-Union-Address topic model.
